# measurements_project
EAS3800C final project

The intention of the measurements_proj file is to compile every component of each lesson required into one single file, rather than 4. 
Its creation was done in such a way that components can be left out if a sensor is not used.

Each lesson arduino file has been added to this repo for reference.

The external library zip files have also been added, if your Arduino IDE does not already have them.
